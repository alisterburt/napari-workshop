# SwissBIAS napari intro and plugins 11/21

This workshop will take you through the basics of bioimage analysis in Python and [napari](https://www.napari.org) and introduce you to the napari plugin engine. We will be performing some analysis on segmented nuclei using a combination of `napari`, `scikit-image`, `scipy`, and `cellpose`. Additionally, we will make a spot detection plugin.

## Instructors
The instructors for this session are Kevin Yamauchi ([@ky396](https://twitter.com/ky396)) and Lorenzo Gaifas ([@brisvag](https://twitter.com/brisvag)).

## Goals
The aim of this workshop is to provide an introduction to bioimage analysis in Python and `napari`. By the end of the workshop you should be able to
- use napari as an image viewer
- perform interactive analysis with napari in a [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
- make use of the [napari plugin ecosystem](https://www.napari-hub.org/)
- make simple plugins using the napari hookspecs
